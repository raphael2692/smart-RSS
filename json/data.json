Although there have been various attempts to apply this approach to robotics, robots have not yet leveraged highly-capable models as well as other subfields. ","36":"Analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has a tremendous potential for enhancing patient care, quantitatively measuring performance of clinical practices, and facilitating clinical research. Statistical estimation and machine learning (ML) models trained on EHR data can be used to predict the probability of various diseases (such as diabetes), track patient wellness, and predict how patients respond to specific drugs. For such models, researchers and practitioners need access to EHR data. However, it can be challenging to leverage EHR data while ensuring data privacy and conforming to patient confidentiality regulations (such as HIPAA).  ","37":"In many computing applications the system needs to make decisions to serve requests that arrive in an online fashion. Consider, for instance, the example of a navigation app that responds to driver requests. In such settings there is inherent uncertainty about important aspects of the problem. For example, the preferences of the driver with respect to features of the route are often unknown and the delays of road segments can be uncertain. The field of online machine learning studies such settings and provides various techniques for decision-making problems under uncertainty. ","38":"Today many people have digital access to their medical records, including their doctor\u2019s clinical notes. However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts. For example, a doctor might write in their clinical notes, \u201cpt referred to pt for lbp\u201c, which is meant to convey the statement: \u201cPatient referred to physical therapy for low back pain.\u201d  Coming up with this translation is tough for laypeople and computers because some abbreviations are uncommon in everyday language (e.g., \u201clbp\u201d means \u201clow back pain\u201d), and even familiar abbreviations, such as \u201cpt\u201d for \u201cpatient\u201d, can have alternate meanings, such as \u201cphysical therapy.\u201d To disambiguate between multiple meanings, the surrounding context must be considered.

","40":"Differential privacy (DP) is an approach that enables data analytics and machine learning (ML) with a mathematical guarantee on the privacy of user data.  DP quantifies the \u201cprivacy cost\u201d of an algorithm, i.e., the level of guarantee that the algorithm\u2019s output distribution for a given dataset will not change significantly if a single user\u2019s data is added to or removed from it. The algorithm is characterized by two parameters, \u03b5 and \u03b4, where smaller values of both indicate \u201cmore private\u201d. There is a natural tension between the privacy budget (\u03b5, \u03b4) and the utility of the algorithm: a smaller privacy budget requires the output to be more \u201cnoisy\u201d, often leading to less utility. Thus, a fundamental goal of DP is to attain as much utility as possible for a desired privacy budget. ","41":"Language models (LMs) are the driving force behind many recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. Models like T5, LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM have demonstrated impressive performance on various language tasks.

How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label. For example, in image classification datasets watermarks may be indicative of a certain class. Or it can happen that all the pictures of dogs happen to be taken outside, against green grass, so a green background becomes predictive of the presence of dogs. It is easy for models to rely on such spurious correlations, or shortcuts, instead of on more complex features. Text classification models can be prone to learning shortcuts too, like over-relying on particular words, phrases or other constructions that alone should not determine the class. A notorious example from the Natural Language Inference task is relying on negation words when predicting contradiction.

Scaling up LMs has been shown to improve performance across a range of NLP tasks. For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale. However, one of the challenges of continued scaling is that training new, larger models requires great amounts of computational resources.

This has been exacerbated by the increase in virtual work and remains a challenge as many teams transition to a hybrid work environment with a mix of those working both virtually and in an office. One solution that can address information overload is summarization \u2014 for example, to help users improve their productivity and better manage so much information, we recently introduced auto-generated summaries in Google Docs.  ","118":"The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by the number of its parameters, and as a consequence, finding more effective ways to increase model parameters has become a trend in deep learning research. Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network. Such models have demonstrated better scaling in multiple domains and better retention capability in a continual learning setting (e.g., Expert Gate). However, a poor expert routing strategy can cause certain experts to be under-trained, leading to an expert being under or over-specialized.

Scaling up the size of language models often leads to improved performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks.

On one hand, existing language models that are properly prompted, via chain-of-thought, demonstrate emergent capabilities that carry out self-conditioned reasoning traces to derive answers from questions, excelling at various arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, with chain-of-thought prompting, a model is not grounded in the external world and uses its own internal representations to generate reasoning traces, limiting its ability to reactively explore and reason or update its knowledge. On the other hand, recent work uses pre-trained language models for planning and acting in various interactive environments (e.g., text games, web navigation, embodied tasks, robotics), with a focus on mapping text contexts to text actions via the language model\u2019s internal knowledge. However, they do not reason abstractly about high-level goals or maintain a working memory to support acting over long horizons. ","123":"Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on training intelligent agents using related experiences so they can learn to solve decision making tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons, and designing hardware chips. Due to the generality of RL, the prevalent trend in RL research is to develop agents that can efficiently learn tabula rasa, that is, from scratch without using previously learned knowledge about the problem. However, in practice, tabula rasa RL systems are typically the exception rather than the norm for solving large-scale RL problems. Large-scale RL systems, such as OpenAI Five, which achieves human-level performance on Dota 2, undergo multiple design changes (e.g., algorithmic or architectural changes) during their developmental cycle. This modification process can last months and necessitates incorporating such changes without re-training from scratch, which would be prohibitively expensive.\u00a0","124":"Learn about Building Data Science Solutions on Azure Join us for a discussion on data science on Azure.
